# Women Who Skateboard - Vigo

This site is intended for women based in Vigo who want to meet up and skateboard together in a group.
Skateboarding is heavily dominated by male skaters so with this site we hope to create a warm and welcoming environment for women skaters in the city.

The site will share details on organised meet-ups for skaters in the city.
