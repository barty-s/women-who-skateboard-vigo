# Women Who Skateboard - Vigo

### The Purpose of the project

This project is intended to promote the group "Women Who Skateboard" and to reach the target audience of women based in Vigo, who want to meet up and skateboard together in a group.

Skateboarding is heavily dominated by male skaters, so with this site, the group "Women Who Skateboard" hope to create a warm and welcoming environment for women skaters in the city.

The site will share details of organised meet-ups for skaters in the city.

### User Stories

· Home Page - As a visiting user, I want to learn about the group and the next scheduled meet-up. I want to be able to sign up for the meet-up easily.

· Gallery Page - As a visiting user, I want to be able to see photos of myself, my friends and fellow skaters from any meet-ups I attend.

· Join Us Page - As a visiting user, I want to be able to submit my personal information quickly and easily to join the next meet-up.

· Confirmation Page - As a visiting user, I want to be sure that my name has been registered for the next meet-up and that the group will be expecting me.

### Features

· Nav Bar - the same design is used across all pages of the site. The logo on the left is a link to the Home page and on the right there are links to all the pages of the site. The page that is active is high-lighted in a different color.

· Hero Image - to grab the user's attention and link the color scheme of the site.

· About section - this section describes the group's intentions and target audience.

· Embedded Map - An embedded Google Map of the meeting point has been included to make the site more visual for the user.

· Footer - This styling is uniform across all pages of the site with links to the group's social media sites and links to the site developers's GitHub and LinkedIn pages.

· Gallery of images - This allows new users to see what they can expect from the meet-ups and for returning users to see themselves at previous meet-ups.

· Sign-Up Form - This form allows the user to input their full name, email address and preferred board to skate with.

· Sign-Up Button - Directs the user to a confirmation page. This was the easiest solution to acknowledge the data input by the user without using Javascript.

· Confirmation page - the user is directed to this page to show their request to join the meet-up has been acknowledged.

### Future Features

· Sign-Up Form with Javascript - I'd like to develop the form and send the data to a database. And include if/or functions depending on which type of board the user selects.

· Meet-Up Suggestion Box - I'd like to include this feature so that users can suggest new meet-up locations or other activities and sports so that the group can expand and develop.

· Shop - As the group develops, I'd like to create a shop that sells the group's merch and skateboarding related products.

### Typography and Color Scheme

· The only type face used was Roboto. It is a geometric font with open, curvy shapes. It was manipulated to be bold or capitalized to differentiate the usages e.g. for a heading or a paragraph.

· The color scheme is derrived from the hero-image using the color picker tool. A dark gray is used as the text color, button color and body background. Light gray and white are used in the nav-bar and icon hover features. Rust-brown is used to hightlight the active page. The colors were selected to coordinate with the hero-image and to allow for sufficient contrast between the various text features on the pages with the background colors.

### Wireframes

Here are the wire frames designed for the three main pages - Home, Gallery and Join-Us. They show the page layout for large-screen devices and the responsive layout for small screen devices. They were designed using Balsamiq.

### Technology

· HTML

· CSS

### Testing

· Code Validation - W3C HTML, CSS (no errors found on first run through)

· Test Cases

· Fixed bugs

· Supported screens and browsers

### Bug Fixes

1st run through WC3 HTML validator - update button and a-link code on each page to follow norms.

2nd run through - bug still not fixed, need new approach to a-link styling. Removed text and spans between list items in the Nav bar unordered list.

3rd run through - changed button to just a link and styled the link element to look like a button. Also, changed color of active link to have more contrast and therefore be more easily readable and improve user accessibility.
